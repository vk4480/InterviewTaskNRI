Note:
Created MVC application named OAuth.API
We are using OctoKit to authenticate Github api 
Username:vk4480 && Pwd:Wipro@1984
clientId = "15004a6aa7ba81e8aa63";
clientSecret = "17e78978d97e0095dda99181a345f766fdc72eca";
To get  the commit comments using the api var commits = await client.Repository.Commit.GetAll(repositories[0].Id); by repo id
Doubly linked list is used to store the comments words and using the quick sort 
We are also getting occurence of each words & storing in dicitonary 
When user login and display the word with occcurence and automatically download the data in csv format in temp folder with name of "SaveFile.CSV"
